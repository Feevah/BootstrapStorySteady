## This app looks good and is almost working. However, the get request is interfering with the BootStrap add-ons So, after you hit the continue button the app crashes. but you can see the database at the /storiesPast route.

### I will either redesign the app with vanilla css and html or change the GET to a POST to see if I can make some progress progress.
